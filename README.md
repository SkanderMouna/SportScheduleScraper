# Web Scraping HOF University Sports Schedule

This repository contains a web scraping script using Puppeteer to extract sports schedules from the HOF University website. The extracted data is saved as a CSV file. Additionally, there are plans to convert the data into iCalendar format (.ics) for future use.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine
- npm package manager

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.

## Usage
1. Run the scraping script by executing `node scrape.js`.
2. The script will navigate to the HOF University website, scrape the sports schedule data, and save it as a CSV file named `plan.csv` in the project directory.

## Future Improvements
- Implement conversion of the scraped data into iCalendar format (.ics) for better compatibility with calendar applications.
- Add error handling to handle various edge cases and website changes.
- Improve documentation for better understanding and maintainability.
